### Supporting Files

There are 4 zip files in this repository: 

1. __SimilarityMatrixExploration:__ Zip file of sources/scripts which allows Protein clustering Exploration starting from an already computed similarity matrix.

2. __SimilarityMatrixExplorationviaTMscoreCOMPLETE:__ Zip file of sources/scripts for the entire pipeline – download data (creates 850 mb of data) to similarity matrix (the time consuming part) to final clustering.

3. __SimilarityMatrixExplorationviaTMscoreWITHDATA:__ Zip file of sources/scripts for the project with data already downloaded (creates 850 mb of data).  Goes from similarity matrix to final clustering. 

4. __SpectralClusteringTutorials:__ Basic Spectral Clustering Tutorial as Jupyter Notebooks (entire as a zip file – grabbed from an undergrad course).
